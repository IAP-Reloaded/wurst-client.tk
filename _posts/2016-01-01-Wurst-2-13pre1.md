Happy new year! Here's a pre-release of Wurst 2.13 for those who can't wait. Navigator works pretty well so far, but I don't think it can fully replace ClickGUI yet, as it is still missing the Target and AutoBuild selectors. That's why I call this a pre-release.

Changes to Navigator since the sneak peek video:

- Added a "Settings" section with sliders

- Added scrollbars everywhere, to make sure everything fits into smaller screens

- Added a "Keybinds" section where you can easily add & remove keybinds (without having to remember what the right command is)

- Added intelligent sorting (Navigator will learn your preferences and show your favorite features at the top)

- Changed the buttons at the bottom so they use the Wurst style instead of the Minecraft style

- Made the animation when you click on a feature much smoother

**Note:** Navigator does not yet have a keybind by default. You need to manually create a keybind for `.t navigator` before you can use it.
