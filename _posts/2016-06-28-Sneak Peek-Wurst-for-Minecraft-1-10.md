Big news: Wurst will finally get an ASM injection system!

So what does that mean? Previously, Wurst was made using the MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack). It was nice and easy to use, but updating to a new Minecraft version took forever. And now that Mojang is releasing tons of updates really quickly, that's a BIG problem!

ASM injection is different: It's much harder to set up at first, but updating is quick and easy. The ASM framework that we have set up can even update itself automatically and works on multiple Minecraft versions with the same code.

And because it's so hard to set up, we are not going to use it on Wurst right away. Wurst has hundreds of features that all need to be rewritten in order to work with this new system.

Instead, we will be releasing a mini-version of Wurst that is built with our ASM framework. This client will be called "WÃ¼rstchen", as that's the German word for a mini-sausage.

If you haven't already, watch the video above to see the ASM framework in action!
