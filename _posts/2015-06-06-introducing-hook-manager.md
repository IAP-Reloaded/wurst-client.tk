<a href="https://www.hook-manager.tk/">Hook Manager</a>
is an MCP alternative modding tool that will be powering Wurst 2.0 and later versions.

As I said earlier, Wurst 2.0 will be based on Minecraft 1.8.3. I have chosen this version because it contains a number of fixes and performance improvements, but doesn't contain any of the "security fixes" that make it harder to exploit bugs.

Like most hack clients, Wurst currently uses the MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack). MCP is good for beginners as it is easy to use, but it does have some drawbacks. The biggest one is that updating a client that was made with MCP to a new Minecraft version takes a lot of time - usually about a month.

MCP hasn't yet been updated to any later Minecraft version than 1.8.0 and it is very unlikely that it will be updated before Minecraft 1.9 is released, so instead of waiting - or rather hoping - for an MCP update to Minecarft 1.8.3, I decided to make my own modding tool.

This modding tool is called Hook Manager. Unlike MCP, Forge and things like that, Hook Manager works with any Minecraft version. In fact, it works with any version of any Java based program. Once Hook Manager is completed, updating Wurst to the latest Minecraft version will be a lot faster, as I will no longer need to wait for the MCP team.
