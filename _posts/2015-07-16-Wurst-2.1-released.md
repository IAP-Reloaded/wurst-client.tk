Wurst 2.1 comes with lots of new goodies. Here is a list of the best new features.

## 1. YesCheat+ will now block mods instead of disabling them
In the past, it has always been a hassle to turn the non-NoCheat-compatible mods back on after playing on a NoCheat+ server. Now these mods will be put into a "blocked" state where they are still enabled but not doing anything. From there you can turn them on and off however you like, but they will only truly be enabled once you turn off YesCheat+.

## 2. Jesus will now bypass NoCheat+!
Just like Flight, Jesus will now bypass NoCheat+ if YesCheat+ is enabled. Suggested in [#1171](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/1171).

## 3. SkinBlinker mod
SkinBlinker makes your skin blink! Requires a skin with a hat, a jacket or something similar. Suggested in [#1037](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/1037).

## 4. Tired mod
Makes you look extremely tired! I discovered this by accident while working on HeadRoll (see 5).

## 5. HeadRoll mod
Makes you look like you're rolling your head around! Looks a bit like nodding. Suggested in [#1112](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/1112).

## 6. PotionSaver mod
Freezes all potion effects while you are standing still! Suggested in [#596](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/596).

## 7. KillerPotion mod
Generates a potion that can kill players in Creative mode! Suggested in [#1027](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/1027).

## 8. AntiCactus mod
Protects you from cactus damage! I discovered this by accident while working on PotionSaver (see 6).

## 9. `.author` command
Changes the author of a written book. This could be a very useful addition to BookHack, as it allows you to blame someone else for writing the book that destroyed the entire server. :trollface: Made by a contributor in [#1244](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/pull/1244).

## 10. Emergency messages
If something really bad happens that we need to notify everyone about (like the updater breaking again), we are now able to show them a message.

## 11. Better error message for Java 6/7 users
Based on the crash logs that Java 6/7 users have reported recently, their computers should be able to do this check and to show this error message despite everything being based on Java 8.

## 12. Bugfixes
- Fixed a rare crash on startup. Reported in [#617](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/617).

- A rare crash caused by AntiSpam should now be fixed. Reported in [#642](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/642).

- Fixed a problem with the Flight bypass. Reported in [#1222](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst-Client/issues/1222).
