I always try to improve Wurst based on what you like, but that's hard to do without feedback. Let's fix this once and for all.

## How I Used to Handle Feedback
I still remember the very first comments under the very first Wurst video on WiZARDHAX. And I also remember the first negative comment I ever got. It was just one of these random people on YouTube saying "Wurst is the worst". And when I saw this comment, unlike most other client developers who would just insult him back, I asked that random stranger *why* he didn't like Wurst.

Luckily I got a reply from him: He didn't like it because there was no keybind manager and no friends system in Wurst at that time. Then I replied again saying that I put these suggestions on my to-do list and thanking him for the feedback that he gave me. As you probably know, I have added both of these features and they are still in Wurst to this day.

I think that's one of the main reasons why Wurst had such a great success in the beginning. It got from 3 downloads (me, my brother and a friend of mine) to 2000 downloads in the first day of being published, and up to 20 000 downloads in the first two weeks.

## Why that Won't Work Anymore
Once Wurst became more popular, people started suggesting features and reporting bugs way faster than I could possibly implement and fix them. And it just keeps getting more every day. As I am writing this, I have 30 unread suggestions, questions and bug reports. Here is what that looks like:

Crazy, huh? And that's just the stuff that I got in the last 24 hours. In total, I have 1849 "Issues", as GitHub calls them. That means 1849 suggestions, bug reports, questions, etc.

## Why Guessing Won't Work Either
Because there's no way to implement and fix all of the suggestions and bug reports that I get, I used to prioritize suggestions that I liked the most and bugs that annoyed me the most. The problem with that, though: The stuff that I like is not always the same stuff that **you** like.

Believe me, it can be really tough to guess what people like. I've had many times where I thought people would love the stuff that I added, but then no one cared about it. On the other side, I've added features that I thought would be quite boring, but everyone else loved them.

I've recently asked myself how the big guys handle this. How does Google always give you the search results that you want and how is Windows 100% bug free? Even though Google and Microsoft are getting millions of suggestions every day, so much that they can't even read all of it, they seem to always know exactly what people want.

And the answer is that they have machines analyzing trends by simply counting the number of people who like something. You can see an example of this at <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/" target="_blank">google.com/trends</a>, that is Google's data centers calculating exactly what has been hot in the last 24 hours.

Now what's the difference between me and Google? It's that they have something to count: their searches. That's not quite as easy for me. I mean, I can count the number of duplicate Issues on my GitHub page, but that's pretty much it. I don't really have a good way of analyzing what people want.

## How I'm Going to Solve it
Enough about the problem, I want to tell you the solution! I did a lot of research about feedback collection and came up with a quick, yet powerful feedback survey. It has only six questions and you can probably fill it out in under five minutes, but it will finally allow me to find out exactly what you want in Wurst.

Also, it requires no account, no e-mail address, no nothing to fill out this survey. Just click the big blue feedback button:

<div class="text-center">
  <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/8YiGUjfvMi" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'call to action', 'give feedback');">
    Give Feedback
  </a>
</div>

Also, please be sure to share this post. The more people give me feedback, the more I can use it to improve Wurst. Even if you know someone who hates Wurst, ask them to fill out this survey. It helps a lot!
