There hasn't been a Wurst update last Friday, as I've been working on some other things this week. So instead of a Wurst update video, I'll tell you what I've been working on. I'm mainly working on the [Wurst website](/) right now, redesigning it and changing up a few things.

This website is where people go to download Wurst, so it's important that I work on it as well. If I would only work on Wurst, no one would go to the website to even download it.

I'm also working on the Wurst Feedback App and the Fan Shop, so pretty much all the other websites about Wurst. You will now be able to sort feedback on the Feedback App based on popularity, date posted and amount of votes (and yes, pages/infinite scrolling will be added soon).

While we're at it, if there's a feature that you want to see in the next Wurst update, be sure to vote for it on the [Wurst Feedback App](https://feedback.wurst-client.tk/). Or if you have nothing to do, give me some feedback about the [Wurst YouTube Channel](/youtube) or the [Wurst Fan Shop](/fanshop). These two are still relatively new and I need some feedback to improve them.

Additionally, I've recorded for WiZARDHAX.com another time. You can watch that video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12R6o7xBBT0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12R6o7xBBT0</a>
