Minecraft 1.8 introduced a bunch of new bugs that can be exploited to do all kinds of really cool stuff. In Wurst v1.15, I have added 5 new Exploits that allow you to piss off server admins like never before.

Before you ask: Wurst v2.0 is not cancelled, but delayed.

![OP-Sign exploit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/8161132/288c3f24-1375-11e5-860b-4d700470a071.jpg)

## 1. OP-Sign exploit
The OP-Sign exploit gives you a sign that makes you an admin once you click on it! The way it works is similar to the way how [BookHack](/news/2015-04-18-Wurst-v1.13/) works: It creates a sign with a special code that causes it to run a command whenever someone clicks on it. But what makes it much cooler than BookHack is that you don't need an admin to click on it in order to run admin commands. The command will always be executed with admin permissions, no matter what your permissions are.

![CrashChest exploit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/8161131/28844c38-1375-11e5-95bf-0e764947244c.jpg)

## 2. CrashChest exploit
The CrashChest exploit gives you a chest that crashes other players and prevents them from ever joining the server again! All you need to do is create a CrashChest, copy it a bunch of times and give all the copies to another player. The next time they join the server, they will instantly get kicked because their inventory contains way too much data. And because they can't do anything to get the chests out of their inventory, they will have to wait for an admin to manually delete their data from the server (provided that the admin even knows how to do that).

Another thing you can do is place a chest and fill it up with CrashChests. Whenever someone opens that chest, they will instantly get kicked from the server, but they will be able to join the server again because the CrashChests are not in their own inventory. So if you just want to troll some people, place a chest full of CrashChests near the spawn and place a sign next to it saying "Look Inside". I did this when I tested the exploit and believe me, it's a lot of fun!

![Command Block exploit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/8161490/944cfa1c-1377-11e5-82e4-5af09743e351.jpg)

## 3. Command Block exploit
This exploit allows you to make Command Blocks without having OP! Some servers have patched the OP-Sign exploit, so this one is a nice alternative. Although Command Blocks can't run the standard `/op` command, they can still cause a lot of damage if you use them correctly. For example, you can make a Command Block machine that copies itself, spreads all across the server and destroys everything in its path. There are plenty of tutorials on YouTube showing you how to do that.

![CrashItem exploit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/8161893/42691188-137a-11e5-9db2-967f8e58cb0b.jpg)

## 4. CrashItem exploit
It converts a normal nametag into a CrashItem. Once you right click a mob with it, it will kick all nearby players from the server! Much like the CrashChest exploit, this one works by adding a ton of data to the nametag so that the server can't keep up with it.

![Flight bypass](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10100202/8162186/fcb1e9ba-137b-11e5-96a8-25e618d084ae.jpg)

## 5. Flight bypass
Celebrate! We finally got the Flight bypass in Wurst. The normal Flight mod will now bypass NoCheat+ whenever YesCheat+ is enabled. I have already seen this exploit being incredibly useful on minigame servers, as it allows you to reach places you normally couldn't.

## Bonus: TrollPotion
I call this a bonus because it isn't exactly an exploit, but it is definitely a must-have for anyone who likes to troll other people in Minecraft. :trollface: This mod generates an incredibly annoying potion that has all kinds of crazy effects on it, including dizzyness, blindness, poison and a lot more. The effects can theoretically last for over 60 years and prevent people from dying, so they cannot be cancelled by simply jumping into a lake of lava. Should you ever get hit by a TrollPotion yourself, the only way to get rid of it is by drinking a bucket of milk.
