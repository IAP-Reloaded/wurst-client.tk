In the last couple of days, some big problems with Wurst 2.0 screwed up several months of work, but not everything is lost.

### Minecraft 1.8.3
Minecraft 1.8.3 has a lot of improvements and bugfixes in it, but none of the security fixes that prevent us from exploiting bugs. The problem is, however, that the MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack) isn't available for Minecraft 1.8.3 and likely never will be. So my plan was to set up my own alternative to the MCP and to use that for Wurst. This alternative is called [Hook Manager](https://www.hook-manager.tk/). After more than a month, all the important features in Hook Manager are implemented and only a couple of bugs keep it from reaching v1.0.

Hook Manager basically makes Minecraft (or any other Java program) editable without deobfuscating it. The deobfuscation is the main reason why it takes months before the MCP is updated to a new Minecraft version, so I thought that skipping this step would make it much easier and faster to update Wurst to a new Minecraft version. However, the obfuscated class, field and method names are much harder to work with than I thought. They all change whenever a new Minecraft version is released, so I would have to correct all the references to them without even knowing what they are.

So in the end, I would still need to do all of the deobfuscation work that the MCP team has to do, but as a single person. It would be much more harmful than beneficial to the future development of Wurst, therefore I have decided to cancel the update to Minecraft 1.8.3.

### GUI Improvements
My original plan was to use Swing to render the GUI, which would make it easy to add text fields, scrollbars, etc. to it. However, shortly after I announced this change, I noticed that a big problem with this idea: Because the frames in GUI would be external windows (instead of being part of the Minecraft window), they would not be recognized by screen recorders that are recording the Minecraft window.

Many screen recorders (including Fraps) cannot be set to record more than one window at a time, those that can are usually very slow. Just like Minecraft, Wurst got most of its popularity through YouTube, so losing all the high quality Wurst videos (those that run at more than 4 FPS and display things correctly) would definitely hurt a lot!

I have tried many alternative solutions, such as:

- having the Swing components inside of the Minecraft window,

- using HTML instead of Swing,

- and using JavaFX instead of Swing.

While all of these solutions have different advantages, they all had the same problem: It is impossible to render them on top of an LWJGL GUI (what Minecraft uses) with transparency. Having an opaque GUI makes it totally impractical, because you can't see what's going on around you while having it open. You can't see the Creeper right in front of you, just about to explode. And no matter how nice it might look, this absolutely sucks!

To ensure that the GUI stays both pretty and practical and to prevent yet another month of wasted effort, I decided to cancel this change as well. I may, however, make some improvements to the old, LWJGL based GUI instead. I wont completely redesign it though. I don't want to join the rat race of designers that has been going on lately, where everyone completely changed the style of their clients - over and over again - thinking that that would make their clients more popular.

I seem to be the only one who has heard the saying: "Keep your logo and your style as long as you can, that way people will remember your brand!". With all those clients constantly changing their looks nowadays, you can't really tell the difference anymore. The moment you memorized a logo or a color scheme, it changes completely. Keeping the style of Wurst has been a huge advantage recently, enough to turn it into the 4th most popular client on [WiZARDHAX.com](http://www.wizardhax.com/) (it was #5 before).

### Java 8
The third and easiest major change planned for Wurst 2.0 is to take full advantage of Java 8. So far, there haven't been any problems with this.

### More changes
Only implementing Java 8 and slight GUI improvements makes Wurst 2.0 seem quite small, honestly. But there is a pretty easy way to fix this: bringing all kinds of minor, backwards compatible changes into it. This basically means adding a bunch of new mods, commands and exploits.

So that is the current status of Wurst 2.0.
