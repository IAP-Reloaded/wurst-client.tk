The new Wurst Client wiki makes it easier than ever to find information about Wurst. And if there is something you can't find, you can add it!

Over the last couple of days, I've completely rewritten the Wurst wiki and I am now happy to announce version 3 of it. This new wiki makes it easier than ever for you to edit it. All you need is a GitHub account and enough power in your hand to move your mouse to the `Edit` button that you can now find at the top of every wiki page.

In the past, I have gotten a lot of messages and emails from people who wanted to contribute to the wiki (version 2), but were unable to do so because they didn't understand how GitHub's built-in wikis work. Now, hopefully, these sad people should be much happier. :smile:

Now of course the main reason for making a wiki is to provide information. If it goes well, this wiki will ensure that all of the information about Wurst is kept in one central place, making it easier for everyone to find this information.

When I got started with Minecraft, I wanted to be an expert at it from the beginning on, so I read nearly every page of the Minecraft wiki before I even bought my Minecraft account. Who knows, maybe there is someone similar to me out there who can now do the same thing with Wurst.

This wiki should also significantly reduce the amount of questions that we get on the Wurst Client GitHub page, meaning less hard work for me and the people who have decided to voluntarily answer some of the questions for me (they are awesome!).

The new wiki can be found at [Wurst-Client.tk/wiki](https://www.wurst-client.tk/wiki/). Check it out!
