This video shows how I made some of the bugfixes in Wurst 3.0 for Minecraft 1.9. It covers the following:

- Fixing the Timer mod

- Improving the CleanUp feature

- Attempting to hack the protocol so that Wurst could connect to Minecraft 1.9.2 servers

- Fixing the Tracers mod by using a vector

This should give you a bit of an insight to what the programming behind all of those Wurst updates actually looks like.

I have to admit that this wasn't my most productive coding session, as I spent over an hour just trying to figure out what was wrong with Tracers, but I think that you can still learn something from it.
