This video is a sneak peek of the upcoming Wurst 2.13 update showing some of the new features. The main change in this update is the addition of the Navigator, which displays a searchable list of all features in Wurst and allows the user to manage them much more easily than through traditional user interfaces. Some of the features will also have a "Tutorial" button in them that leads to a tutorial video or Wiki page. The goal of that is to make Wurst more beginner-friendly and to ease the progress of getting started.
