Today I'm very happy to announce that we now have a Wurst Client Fan Shop. I have been working on this fan shop for quite some time, and now it's finally up and running.

If you are following me on Twitter, you already know that I recently got a new mouse pad with a picture of me lighting a bunch of TNT blocks on fire, with the Heading "Keep Griefin'". This is one of the products that you can get in this fan shop.

The other products, at least for now, are a mug and a T-shirt with the same image printed on them. The T-shirt comes in white and black by default, but can be customized to have any color you like. Here are some examples:

You can get to the shop by using the button below, or read on to find out the story behind the Keep Griefin' design.

## The Story Behind Keep Griefin'
At the first glance you might think griefers are evil, especially if you see them destroying servers, trolling admins and setting houses on fire. However, an experienced griefer knows that there is much more to it than that. The real evil ones in Minecraft are the server admins, the ones that ban people for no reason.

We've all been there, playing on a server for a couple of weeks, having a pretty decent base all set up... and then losing it all because some admin felt like banning you. For many griefers, including me, that's the reason why we started griefing.

However, there are a lot of people out there who don't understand this. So a lot of griefers, especially the ones on YouTube, get a lot of hate from these people. That includes people insulting them, people spamming their YouTube channels, and even people threatening to report them to the police (even though griefing is not illegal).

I've seen all of that. Back in the days when the Wurst Client was in its Private Beta phase, I started a YouTube channel called "Grief Wurst", together with a friend of mine who is now part of the Wurst-Imperium. After uploading the first video, the admins of the server that we griefed found the channel and messed it all up.

Another time, the admins of a server threatened to report me to the police for griefing their server. Nowadays, I know that there is nothing illegal about griefing servers in Minecraft, but at the time I didn't know that. It was a big shock for me, especially because they had my IP address.

Sometimes it seems like everyone is going against you, and that can make it tough to keep going. How can you believe that what you're doing is right when everyone else tells you that it's wrong?

And that is the message behind this image: Keep griefin', no matter what others say. I find it to be a great motivation, especially the mouse pad version, as you can see that while you're griefing.

## What's Next
Of course Wurst isn't only being used by griefers. Another large group are the PVPers, and I'm definitely planning to add something for them as well.

Other than that, please tell me in the comments section below what you think about this fan shop or if you have an idea what else I should add to it.
