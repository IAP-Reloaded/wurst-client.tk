Microsoft HoloLens will totally revolutionize the way we build, mine and of course grief in Minecraft. I've been watching this project for a long time and I know that Microsoft is working on [HoloLens APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32fTwC5Prbg) in many different programming languages, including Java. So it should be no problem to make future versions of Wurst compatible to it.
