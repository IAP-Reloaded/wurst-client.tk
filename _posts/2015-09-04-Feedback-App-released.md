Let's get your voices heard.

As I mentioned in a [previous post](/news/2015-08-15-feedback), feedback is a very important thing for me. As Wurst is getting more and more popular, I'm also getting more and more feedback every day, and it's getting pretty hard to manage.

I could sit there all day reading and answering all of your comments, suggestions, bug reports, questions, etc., but then I would no longer have the time to use any of that feedback. Sometimes I have actually spent entire days just reading and answering feedback on my GitHub page.

Furthermore, it's really hard for me to recognize patterns in the feedback: Out of 100 people, there might be 30 people wanting one feature, but only 10 people wanting another feature. Unless I make a table of all suggestions and the number of people wanting them, there is no way I could see things like that.

About a month ago, I realized what a big problem this is and I have since been working on a solution. Luckily, it seems that Microsoft has had the same problem with Windows 10, and they came up with an **amazing** solution!

They call this the Windows Feedback App. One user submits a piece of feedback and users who agree with him vote for that feedback. This is awesome for two reasons: They know exactly how many people want a certain thing and they don't have to read and make tables all day to figure it out.

I've already submitted a few suggestions myself and some of them actually got implemented. Microsoft Edge can now import bookmarks from Chrome because of me. How crazy is that?!

If it works so well for a company as big as Microsoft, then sure it will do wonders on the Wurst Client. That's why I've spent the last 2-3 weeks rebuilding this app. Here is what my version looks like:

If it works well, I will integrate this app into the Wurst Client itself. But first I need to make sure that the server can actually handle the traffic and won't go down after a few days.

So for now, you can only get to the app using this link: [https://feedback.wurst-client.tk/](https://feedback.wurst-client.tk/)

Please note that you do need to register an account before you can submit feedback or votes. This is meant to prevent spam and to ensure that everyone can only vote once.

**Update:** There has been a bug that prevented people with a Yahoo Mail address from registering. This bug is now fixed.
