Back in the day when I [updated Wurst to Minecraft 1.8](https://old.wurst-client.tk/news/wurstforminecraft18-firstpre-releaseavailable), I made a pre-release as soon as I got a somewhat working version and then kept making more pre-releases until it was stable. The update to Minecraft 1.9 will work the same way.

**Working features:**

- Most commands
- FastPlace
- Flight
- All Killauras & TriggerBot
- Movement hacks (Spider, Glide, etc.)
- ServerFinder

<!--read more-->

**Broken features:**

- AutoArmor
- AutoSoup
- AutoSplashPot, .potion, etc.
- AutoBuild, BuildRandom, etc.
- BowAimbot & Trajectories
- All ESPs

Everything not listed above is untested and could be either working or broken. The auto-updater _should_ be working, but I cannot guarantee it.

**If you get a crash:**
Delete `modules.json` in your Wurst folder (default location: `%appdata%\.minecraft\wurst`).

**Bug reports** are closed for now. Here are some statistics of the bug reports that we got:
