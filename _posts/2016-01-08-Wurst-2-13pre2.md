And as always, here's the changelog:

- :new: Shift-clicking a feature will now directly execute its primary action (e.g. toggle a mod).

- :star: Navigator will now better learn your preferences to make sure that the features you use the most are at the top of the list.

- :star: The scrollbar will now only show if it is needed.

- :bug: Fixed MenuWalk breaking Navigator.

- :art: Made some adjustments to the design of certain Navigator elements.

- :gem: Cleaned up some of the code behind Navigator.

By the way, Navigator still doesn't have a keybind by default. So if you haven't already, add a keybind for ".t navigator" in the Keybind Manager.
