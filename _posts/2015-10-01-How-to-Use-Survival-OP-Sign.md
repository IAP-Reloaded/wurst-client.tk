After the release of Wurst 2.5, a lot of people asked me how to use the new Survival OP-Sign mod. So today I'm going to explain that.

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={{ page.video }}), I'm going to walk you through the entire process of using OP-Sign, with everything explained in detail and no step skipped.

If you can't watch the video for some reason, here is the text version of the tutorial:

First off, as mentioned before, this requires a server running **Minecraft 1.8 - 1.8.5 without Spigot**. If the server you are using runs Minecraft 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.8.8 or any later version, then you can't use it on that server. The same goes for servers running Minecraft 1.7.X or anything with Spigot.

So how do you find servers that have the right version? The easiest way is to use the **ServerFinder**. If you don't know what the ServerFinder is, it's basically a tool for finding tons of easy-to-grief servers within just a few minutes.

Just press the ServerFinder button in the Multiplayer menu, type in a numeric server IP (like `85.131.231.92`) and press the <kbd>Search</kbd> button. For a more detailed tutorial with pictures, have a look at the [ServerFinder wiki page](/wiki/Special_Features/Server_Finder/).

So now you should have a huge list of servers with green text showing their versions. Just look for one that has the correct version and join it. Easy, right?

Now you need to get a sign, but don't place it yet. You first turn on the OP-Sign mod (press <kbd>LCtrl</kbd>, then click the <kbd>OP-Sign</kbd> button in the `Exploits` window).

A new screen will show up that asks you to enter a command. By default, the command is set to `/op YourName`, which will give you OP on most servers. Just click the <kbd>Done</kbd> button and you'll be fine.

Finally, you place the sign and right click on it. You should now be an OP on that server. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to click the sign multiple times. It's actually better to click it only once because that creates only one message in the server logs, making it less noticeable for the server owner.

One last thing: I can't guarantee that it will work on all servers. Sometimes Spigot servers fake their version info and pretend to be vanilla servers, and sometimes servers have a plugin that blocks OP-Sign. While most servers do work, it's always possible that you run into a server that doesn't.
