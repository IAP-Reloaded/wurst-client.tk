This update makes all of Wurst's PVP mods fully compatible to team based minigames.

## Team Selector
You can now configure Killaura, BowAimbot, FightBot, etc. to only target entities that have a specific nametag color. This is especially useful for PVP games with teams, so you can attack players from the enemy team(s) but not the ones in your team.

To use this feature, go to the Target frame in the ClickGUI (the menu that opens when you press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>) and press the "Team Settings" button. A new menu will open where you can select the nametag colors to be targeted. Once you selected the colors, go back to the ClickGUI and make sure that the "Teams" option in the Target frame is enabled.
